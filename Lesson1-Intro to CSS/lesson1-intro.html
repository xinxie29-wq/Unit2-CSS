    <h1>My Coding Journey</h1>
    
    
    <h2>Welcome to My Developer Portfolio</h2>
    <p>Hi! I'm a future software engineer learning to build amazing applications. This site showcases my journey from beginner to professional developer.</p>
    
    <h2>Programming Languages I'm Learning</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Python - For data analysis and automation</li>
        <li>JavaScript - Building interactive web applications</li>
        <li>HTML & CSS - Creating beautiful websites</li>
        <li>Java - Object-oriented programming fundamentals</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Tips to Become a Better Coder</h2>
    <p>Success in programming isn't just about grades - it's about building skills for your future career. Here's what will make you stand out:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Code every day, even if just 30 minutes - consistency beats cramming</li>
        <li>Build personal projects that interest YOU, not just assignments</li>
        <li>Read other people's code on GitHub - learn from professionals</li>
        <li>Debug your own errors before asking for help - develop problem-solving skills</li>
        <li>Contribute to open source projects - real-world experience matters</li>
        <li>Learn to Google effectively - 80% of coding is knowing what to search</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>My Development Stats</h2>
    <!-- Method1 - Inline CSS - style attribute directly on an element-->
     <p style="font-size: 24px; color: aqua;">Line of code written: 5420</p>
    <p>Lines of code written: 5,420</p>
    <p>Projects completed: 12</p>
    <p>GitHub contributions: 87</p>
    
    <h2>Why Practice Matters More Than Grades</h2>
    <p>In tech interviews, companies don't ask for your GPA - they ask you to solve problems and build things. The developers who practice daily, build side projects, and stay curious are the ones who get hired. Your future employer cares about what you can DO, not just what you memorized for a test.</p>
