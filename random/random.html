        <p class="section">Formula One (F1) is the highest class of worldwide racing for open-wheel single-seater formula racing cars
            sanctioned by the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA). The FIA Formula One World Championship
            has been one of the world's premier forms of motorsport since its inaugural running in 1950 and is often
            considered to be the pinnacle of motorsport. The word formula in the name refers to the set of rules all
            participant cars must follow. A Formula One season consists of a series of races, known as Grands Prix.
            Grands Prix take place in multiple countries and continents on either purpose-built circuits or closed
            roads.

            A points scoring system is used at Grands Prix to determine two annual World Championships: one for the
            drivers, and one for the constructors—now synonymous with teams. Each driver must hold a valid Super
            Licence, the highest class of racing licence the FIA issues, and the races must be held on Grade One tracks,
            the highest grade rating the FIA issues for tracks.
